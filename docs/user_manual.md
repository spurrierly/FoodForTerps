The application we designed was intended for those within the College Park area to find restaurants based on their dietary restriction or needs. It would account for factors such as cuisine, ratings, and price. This means, on the main page of the website, the user would input a choice of a cuisine (ex. American, Halal, etc), a rating that ranges from 1-4 stars, and a price range from “$,” “$$,” and “$$$.” After inputting these choices, the website will direct the user to a page where a brief description of a restaurant will be displayed as a result based off of their choices.
